under [Apache-2.0](https://github.com/VidTu/HCsCR/blob/main/LICENSE))

**Q**: Is this mod client-side or server-side?  
**A**: This mod works on the client-side. There's a way to block it as a server,
but there do exist alternative mods, which cannot be blocked that way.

**Q**: Is this a hack?  
**A**: Yes, no, it depends, as your server admin decides, and everything in-between.
Check your server rules for something like "Crystal Optimizer".

It does affect your gameplay by reducing the effects the ping (latency) has on you.

**Q**: Why this mod is not on the Modrinth or CurseForge?  
**A**:

1. *Modrinth*: As per [this message](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/437df1a1-3331-499c-ac49-6ec114494bd4),
   this mod violates the section "3.3d" of [Modrinth Content Rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules) and will require
   a server-side opt-in to be allowed on Modrinth. I can see why Modrinth moderators don't want to have a mod like this
   on their platform, but I (personally) don't want to implement a server-side opt-in.
2. *CurseForge*: I don't really like it, but I might publish this mod there in the future.
